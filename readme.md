# [broccoli](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli)-defeatureify [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/broccoli-defeatureify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/broccoli-defeatureify)

> Remove specially flagged feature blocks and debug statements using [Defeatureify](https://github.com/thomasboyt/defeatureify)

Defeatureify is used in the [ember-dev](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-dev) package to enable
or remove features and strip debug statements during the [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) build process.

Based on [broccoli-persistent-filter](https://github.com/stefanpenner/broccoli-persistent-filter), it allows to cache
filter state across [broccoli](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli) restarts.

*Issues with the output should be reported on the Defeatureify [issue tracker](https://github.com/thomasboyt/defeatureify/issues)*.
